  abstract = {{Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is now widely used in many industrial
	contexts such as the AeroSpace domain which requires a high level
	of system safety. Model-checking is one of the formal techniques
	which are considered to ensure a system compliance to its requirements.
	It relies on verification dedicated languages to model the system
	under verification. In order to ease the use of these tools, model
	transformations are provided that translate the end user provided
	input model of the system to the formal languages than can be verified.
	In order to rely on these activities for system certification, the
	correctness of these transformation steps must be assessed (qualification
	of the development and verification tools). One of the goal of our
	work is to provide tools to implement the transformation steps between
	the end user source languages used for the system development and
	the target languages used for formal verification. In this paper,
	we present a Tom rule-based approach which is used in a research
	project involving industrial partners: Airbus and Ellidiss.}},
