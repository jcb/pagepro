  abstract = {Model Driven Engineering (MDE) advocates the use of Model Transformations
	(MT) in order to automate repetitive development tasks. Many different
	model transformation languages have been proposed with a significant
	development cost as classical elements like expressions, statements,
	. . . must be developed from scratch in each language. The Tom language
	is a shallow extension of Java tailored to describe and implement
	transformations of tree based data-structures. Expressions, statements
	and many other elements rely directly on Java constructs and are
	thus almost costless. A key feature of Tom allows to map any Java
	data-structure to tree based data abstractions that can be accessed
	by pattern matching. In this paper, we present how this approach
	can be extended in order to describe model transformations, and in
	particular EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework) based model transformations.
	This allows to provide a low cost transformation language both on
	the language tool development and on the developpers training side.},
